## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Generals: Zero Hour Game Code** repository! This project is dedicated to the game’s source code, which
enables contributors to work on improvements, fixes, and new features. The **Generals: Zero Hour - Asset Patch** project
focuses on improving the game's assets (textures, localizations, models), whereas this project centers on the underlying
game mechanics and the technical aspects of *Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour*. If you're interested in coding,
modifying, or extending the game’s core functionality, you're in the right place!

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the project, you will need a basic understanding of the source code and how to build it. If you're
new to the project, here’s how you can contribute:

- Check out the [**Build Guides**](build_guides) for instructions on how to compile the game code on
  different platforms.
- Learn about the project's **dependencies** and **libraries** in the [Dependencies](Dependencies) section.
- Look through the **community forks** and other variations of the project in the [Forks](Forks) section.
- If you're an experienced developer, you can start contributing by reviewing and submitting **pull requests** or
  opening **issues**.
